    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <h3>1. Marinate the Chicken:</h3>
    <ul class="bullet">
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, turmeric, chili powder, coriander, garam masala, cumin, black pepper, cilantro, and mint leaves.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil or ghee to the marinade for extra richness.</li>
        <li>Mix well to coat the chicken evenly and refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours (preferably overnight for deeper flavor).</li>
    </ul >
    <h3>2. Prepare the Rice:</h3>
    <ul class="bullet">
        <li>Rinse the basmati rice several times in cold water until the water runs clear (to remove excess starch).</li>
        <li>In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, cloves, bay leaf, cumin seeds, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the rinsed rice and cook for about 6-7 minutes, or until the rice is about 70-80% cooked (the grains shoul class="bullet"d still be firm).</li>
        <li>Drain the rice and set it aside.</li>
    </ul >
    <h3>3. Fry the Onions:</h3>
    <ul class="bullet">
        <li>In a large pan, heat 2 tablespoons of ghee or butter over medium heat.</li>
        <li>dd the thinly sliced onions and fry them until golden brown and crispy. This can take about 10-15 minutes. Be careful class="bullet" not to burn them.</li>
        <li>Remove the fried onions and drain on paper towels. Set aside for garnishing later.</li>
    </ul >
    <h3>4. Cook the Chicken:</h3>
    <ul class="bullet">
        <li>In the same pan, heat 1 tablespoon of ghee or butter over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for a minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and release their juice (about 5 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add the marinated chicken along with all the marinade into the pan. Stir well and cook the chicken for 10-15 minutes, until it is nearly cooked through and the oil starts to separate from the masala.</li>
        <li>If the sauce is too thick, add a little water to make it more of a gravy-like consistency. (The chicken will continue to cook with the rice, so don't cook it completely at this stage.)</li>
    </ul >
    <h3>5. Layer the Biryani:</h3>
    <ul class="bullet">
        <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, layer the partially cooked chicken with its gravy at the bottom.</li>
        <li>Layer the cooked rice on top of the chicken, spreading it evenly.</li>
        <li>Garnish the rice with fresh cilantro, mint, and fried onions.</li>
        <li>If you're using saffron, drizzle the saffron milk over the top for added color and fragrance.</li>
        <li>Optionally, sprinkle rose water or kewra water over the top for extra aroma.</li>
    </ul >
    <h3>6. Dum (Steaming) the Biryani:</h3>
    <ul class="bullet">
        <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. If your lid doesn't fit well, you can seal it with dough or cover with foil to lock in the steam.</li>
        <li>Place the pot over low heat for 20-30 minutes to allow the biryani to steam. You can also cook it in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for 20-25 minutes.</li>
        <li>This process is known as Dum, and it helps the flavors to meld together and makes the rice fluffier.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>7. Serve:</h3>
    <ul class="bullet">
        <li>After the biryani has steamed, gently fluff the rice with a fork to mix the chicken and rice together.</li>
        <li>Serve the chicken biryani hot, garnished with additional fried onions, cilantro, and mint if desired.</li>
    </ul >
    <h3>Tips:</h3>
    <ul class="bullet">
        <li>Basmati Rice: Use long-grain, aged basmati rice for the best texture and fragrance.</li>
        <li>Chicken: Bone-in chicken (like drumsticks or thighs) will give you more flavor, but boneless chicken is quicker to cook.</li>
        <li>Saffron: If you don't have saffron, you can skip it, but it adds a beautiful class="bullet" color and fragrance.</li>
        <li>Resting: Let the biryani rest for about 10 minutes after you remove it from the heat before serving. This helps the flavors settle.</li>
        <li>Ghee: Ghee (clarified butter) enhances the richness and flavor of the biryani, but you can substitute it with oil if necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Serving Suggestions:</h3>
    <ul class="bullet">
        <li>Chicken biryani is often served with raita (a yogurt-based side dish), salad, or boiled eggs on the side.</li>
        <li>You can also serve it with pickle or papad for extra flavor.</li>
    </ul>
